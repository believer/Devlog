  I haven't thought about using my sidebar/file explorer to the right in Neovim (or in any other IDE I've ever used for that matter). After reading through the answers in this Twitter question I found it interesting that with the sidebar to the right, the code won't shift when toggling it. I think a lot of people keep the file explorer open while developing and don't experience this, but I always close it when I don't use it. I'm going to try using the sidebar to the right for a while and see if it sticks.
