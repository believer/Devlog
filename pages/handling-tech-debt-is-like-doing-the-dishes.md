  Handling tech debt is like doing the dishes
tags: 'page'
excerpt: |
  Whenever you procrastinate on doing the dishes – even if it's only a plate, a knife, and a fork – something happens. The dishes start to pile up since there's already something in the sink. If you have a dishwasher there might be a feeling that "the dishwasher must be full or running or clean and I don't want to be the one to handle it". You do this knowing full well that the problem will become more of a hassle with each item that gets added to the pile.
