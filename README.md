# devlog

This is my attempt at learning in public and the site is available at https://devlog.willcodefor.beer. I'm using [Logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq) to do my writing and generate pages using [eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/).

## Get started

- Fork the repo
- `npm install`
- Export your graph as JSON from Logseq. Save the file as `data.json` in the
  root of the project
- Run `npm start` to generate the files into the folders `/pages` and `/journals`
- Run `npm run css:prod` to compile the CSS
- Run `npm run serve` to start eleventy
- Go to http://localhost:8080

The project is also ready to deploy on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/believer)
