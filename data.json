After reading through the answers in this [Twitter question](https://twitter.com/code/status/1346573944703348743) I found it interesting that with the sidebar to the right, the code won't shift when toggling it. I think a lot of people keep the file explorer open while developing and don't experience this, but I always close it when I don't use it. I'm going to try using the sidebar to the right for a while and see if it sticks."}]},{"id":"60f3377c-26e2-45f2-ab14-2c5c853e82bb","page-name":"Max Rozen","properties":{"public":true},"children":[{"id":"60f3377c-df9d-4577-b4b4-85e7cc5b731b","properties":{"public":true},"format":"markdown","children":[],"body":[["Paragraph",[["Break_Line"]]]],"content":"public:: true\n\n"},{"id":"60f3377c-8f9e-4d30-9c6b-928b0a7b78f4","format":"markdown","children":[],"title":[["Link",{"url":["Complex",{"protocol":"https","link":"twitter.com/RozenMD"}],"label":[["Plain","Twitter"]],"full_text":"[Twitter](https://twitter.com/RozenMD)","metadata":""}]],"body":[],"content":"[Twitter](https://twitter.com/RozenMD)"}]},{"id":"60f3377c-c853-4038-9101-f5a0cccb4323","page-name":"2021-06-10","properties":{"public":true},"children":[{"id":"60f3377c-7ebc-46f6-ae54-7ca574f56609","properties":{"public":true},"format":"markdown","children":[],"body":[["Paragraph",[["Break_Line"]]]],"content":"public:: true\n\n"},{"id":"60f3377c-592e-4625-96b9-6706f78a6d7c","format":"markdown","children":[{"id":"60f3377c-8356-4283-8e85-f5f6551aa4c7","format":"markdown","children":[],"title":[["Plain","Since I always forget it I've created a snippet for it.
