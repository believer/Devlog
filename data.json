After reading through the answers in this [Twitter question](https://twitter.com/code/status/1346573944703348743) I found it interesting that with the sidebar to the right, the code won't shift when toggling it. I think a lot of people keep the file explorer open while developing and don't experience this, but I always close it when I don't use it. I'm going to try using the sidebar to the right for a while and see if it sticks."}]},{"id":"60dc7f32-21e6-4989-aca6-2ca293d48578","page-name":"SSR","children":[{"id":"60dc7f31-cc9d-461b-9e22-f3d746eebd8f","format":"markdown","children":[],"title":[["Plain","Server-side rendering"]],"body":[],"content":"Server-side rendering"}]},{"id":"60dc7f32-fb99-4fd8-8af5-abf7be6de7d7","page-name":"Firefox","properties":{"public":true},"children":[{"id":"60dc7f32-1010-4d0b-b1ca-d07303e820d8","properties":{"public":true},"format":"markdown","children":[],"body":[["Paragraph",[["Break_Line"]]]],"content":"public:: true\n\n"},{"id":"60dc7f32-280b-443c-aaf1-069eac672aa9","format":"markdown","children":[],"title":[],"body":[],"content":""}]},{"id":"60dc7f32-c338-4f8b-a2d0-5905346ec34e","page-name":"ESLint","properties":{"public":true},"children":[{"id":"60dc7f31-32db-4527-b07d-031e20b61d14","properties":{"public":true},"format":"markdown","children":[],"body":[["Paragraph",[["Break_Line"]]]],"content":"public:: true\n\n"},{"id":"60dc7f31-065c-4b9e-9eaa-3088fec1db84","format":"markdown","children":[],"title":[],"body":[],"content":""}]},{"id":"60dc7f32-8c6c-497b-8ee9-67b981957d39","page-name":"2021-06-15","children":[{"id":"60dc7f31-c2da-448f-a723-8138abf078fe","format":"markdown","children":[{"id":"60dc7f31-698b-43b8-b0f8-3ea62db84863","format":"markdown","children":[],"title":[["Plain","A great way of finding out whether an array method is mutating or not is by using "],["Link",{"url":["Complex",{"protocol":"https","link":"//doesitmutate.xyz/"}],"label":[["Plain","https://doesitmutate.xyz/"]],"full_text":"https://doesitmutate.xyz/","metadata":""}]],"body":[],"content":"A great way of finding out whether an array method is mutating or not is by using https://doesitmutate.xyz/"},{"id":"60dc7f31-dc85-4f61-9bf7-39c5f8c15370","format":"markdown","children":[],"title":[],"body":[["Src",{"lines":["// React app","\n","\t  ","\n","const data = [{ name: 'Test Testsson' }, { name: 'Aaron Aaronson' }];","\n","\t  ","\n","// Incorrect","\n","// The sorting operation that was used didn't really work as expected","\n","// and since the sort method is mutating the original data","\n","// we got some unexpected results","\n","data.sort((a, b) => a.name > b.name).map((user) => <div>{user.name}</div>);","\n","\t  ","\n","// Correct","\n","// Use the slice method to create a copy of the array","\n","// to not mutate the original data.","\n","// Update the sorting operation to use localeCompare for better results","\n","data","\n","  .slice()","\n","  .sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name))","\n","  .map((user) => <div>{user.name}</div>);","\n"],"language":"js","pos_meta":{"start_pos":511,"end_pos":1185},"full_content":"```js\n// React app\n\nconst data = [{ name: 'Test Testsson' }, { name: 'Aaron Aaronson' }];\n\n// Incorrect\n// The sorting operation that was used didn't really work as expected\n// and since the sort method is mutating the original data\n// we got some unexpected results\ndata.sort((a, b) => a.name > b.name).map((user) => <div>{user.name}</div>);\n\n// Correct\n// Use the slice method to create a copy of the array\n// to not mutate the original data.\n// Update the sorting operation to use localeCompare for better results\ndata\n  .slice()\n  .sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name))\n  .map((user) => <div>{user.name}</div>);\n```"}]],"content":"\t  ```js\n// React app\n\nconst data = [{ name: 'Test Testsson' }, { name: 'Aaron Aaronson' }];\n\n// Incorrect\n// The sorting operation that was used didn't really work as expected\n// and since the sort method is mutating the original data\n// we got some unexpected results\ndata.sort((a, b) => a.name > b.name).map((user) => <div>{user.name}</div>);\n\n// Correct\n// Use the slice method to create a copy of the array\n// to not mutate the original data.\n// Update the sorting operation to use localeCompare for better results\ndata\n  .slice()\n  .sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name))\n  .map((user) => <div>{user.name}</div>);\n```"}],"title":[["Plain","Here's an example of a bug I found recently.
